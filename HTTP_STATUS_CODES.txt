HTTP Status Codes
HTTP status codes are three-digit numeric codes issued by a server in reply to a client's request made to the server. These codes indicate the status of the request and the outcome of the server's processing of the request.
 The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any categorization or classification role.
 The five classes of HTTP status codes are:

1xx (Informational): Provisional response - the request was received, and the process is continuing.
2xx (Successful): The server successfully received and accepted the request.
3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
4xx (Client Error): The client seems to have made a mistake.
5xx (Server Error): The server is responsible for an error.
Some common HTTP status codes include:

200 (OK): The request has succeeded. The server has delivered the requested content.
201 (Created): The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created.
202 (Accepted): The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
204 (No Content): The server has successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.
301 (Moved Permanently): This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
302 Found (Previously "Moved temporarily")
307 (Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1))
400 (Bad Request): The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax.
404 (Not Found): The server cannot find the requested resource.
500 (Internal Server Error): The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.
