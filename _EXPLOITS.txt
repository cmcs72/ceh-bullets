LFI Local File Inclusion 
Local file inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are
already locally present on the server, through the exploitation of vulnerable inclusion
procedures implemented in an application.

UDP provides a mechanism to detect corrupt data in packets, but it does not attempt to
solve other problems that arise with packets, such as lost or out of order packets.
It is implemented in the transport layer of the OSI Model, known as a fast but not
reliable protocol, unlike TCP, which is reliable, but slower then UDP.
Just like how TCP contains open ports for protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SSH and
etcetera, the same way UDP has ports for protocols that work for UDP.

We use Netexec (nxc) to find any users on the domain by trying to brute force RID
## RID
In the context of the Microsoft Windows NT line of computer operating systems, 
the relative identifier (RID) is a variable length number that is assigned 
to objects at creation and becomes part of the object's Security Identifier 
(SID) that uniquely identifies an account or group within a domain. 
The Relative ID Master allocates security RIDs to Domain Controllers 
to assign to new Active Directory security principals (users, groups or computer objects). 
It also manages objects moving between domains.
The Relative ID Master is one role of the Flexible single master operation for assigning RID.
